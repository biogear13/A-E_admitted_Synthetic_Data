# Analysis of A&E admissions
## by Generoso Roberto

> This is an analysis of A&E admissions in a NHS provider from 2014-03-23 to 2018-03-22

## Dataset

> The dataset used in this exploratory analysis is the A&E Synthetic Data which created as a result of an NHS England pilot project to share more data without sacrifising the privacy of patients.

> The database could be accessed with this link: https://data.england.nhs.uk/dataset/a-e-synthetic-data

> The entire database is 4.2gb long and includes A&E consults that led to both admissions and non-admissions in 200+ providers.

> I decided to focus my analysis on just the admissions of the provider with the highest total number of admissions.
